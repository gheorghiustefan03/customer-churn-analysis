A project I've developed as part of my internship at BCR (Commercial Bank of Romania), for predicting customer churn probability based on existing data.
This was achieved using Machine Learning models (LightGBM, Random Forest) and statistical techniques for preparing the data, all within Python, presented within a Jupyter Notebook.
